1.BMI-Calculator
The BMI Calculator is a Python program designed to quickly determine Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user input of weight and height. It offers a user-friendly interface using Tkinter, where individuals can input their weight in kilograms and height in feet and inches. This tool calculates BMI by converting height to centimeters, then applies the BMI formula (weight divided by height squared) to provide a result rounded to one decimal place. It categorizes the BMI result into different weight status categories, such as Underweight, Normal, Overweight, and Obesity. The calculator not only provides instant BMI evaluation but also allows users to reset entries and exit the application conveniently
